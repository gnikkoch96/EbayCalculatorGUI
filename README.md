<h2>Try it for yourself!</h2>
<p>I built a .jar file that you can run which will load the app that is located <a href="https://github.com/gnikkoch96/EbayCalculatorGUI/blob/main/out/artifacts/EbayCalculator_jar/EbayCalculator.jar">here</a></p>
<p>There are two ways to load the app</p>
<ul>
    <li>Type in  "java -jar EbayCalculator.jar" in your conolse (make sure you are in the right directory) </li>
    <li>There is a <a href="https://github.com/gnikkoch96/EbayCalculatorGUI/blob/main/out/artifacts/EbayCalculator_jar/start.bat">start.bat</a> file which is a shell script that will perform the "java -jar EbayCalculator.jar" for you without worrying if you are in the correct directory or not. I suggest creating a shortcut of it, and then placing it somewhere where it can be easily accessed to prevent tedious clicking to get to the file.</li>
</ul>
